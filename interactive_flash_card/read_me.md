One day I was studying french numbers and decided to study using flash cards. Then it popped into my mind that
I can actually challenge myself a little by writing a python script to practice basically anything, whether it's numbers, words, etc.
So here it is the interactive flash card.

IFC receives a CSV file containing two columns one being _Question_ and another being _Answer_.
All you have to do is basically filling the csv and feeding it to IFC. 
Bonne Chance! ^_^
